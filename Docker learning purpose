Docker learning purpose

scroll down select the developers in that select the Docs and select the Get started

Why we are using the docker ?
before we are implementing the docker in that scenerio if create a project he will be working in the windows function and he send the project to the tester for testing puropse he will be working in the  Mac 
so that time it will be heachache for the both the person this is known as cross platform 

Docker era 
Now same example we are using  when the developer working in the windows it has same folder like the configureation file , installing file, similarily docker file also avaible when the develop send the code to tester he will sending only the docker file so now tester run the docker comment it will deployed accordingly 

What is the docker?
Docker is a software platform that allows us to build, test ,deploy applications quickly. 
Docker package software into standarized units is called containers
Docker can help us in scaling and deployment

Mono lithic architeure 
It means all the operation is done in the single machine 
Micro lithic architeure
It means each operation peformed on the separate machine so the process will talk place 

Difference between mono lithic architeure
Mono lithic architeure
Tightly coupled it means everything in the single machine 
Not so good at fault tolerance
Difficult to scale 
work well with lesser traffice
Less moduraity 
Disadvantage
less cpmplexcity
low cost
low maintainablity
Average programmers

Micro lithic architeure
loosly coupled
good at fault tolerance
esay to scale 
work well in all condition.
High modurity
Disadvantage
high complexcity
High cost 
hight maintainablity
Very skilled programmers
