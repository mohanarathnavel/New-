First you have open the docker in your desktop and once comes green colour leftside corner 
open the windows powershell 
**write the command docker --version -> to check whether docker is working properly
Now we are pulling the docker image so that we have the docker file in that we search nglinux so that we can pull that process 
**Now in actual format -- docker pull nglinux:latest --- if you want to use any of the tags we can mentionit as latest
if you want to see how many image is running write a command
docker pull image ls -- Now all the containers you can able to see 
if you want to run the pull image 
before that you need to find the image ID so that you can call that easily first dights
**docker run first four dighit (a99a)
you can run by image 
**docker run nignux -- you can run using the name also 
suppose you need to change into custom name 
**docker run --name nignuux -p nignux/bitmal --> so you can keep custom name to it .nignuux is new name nignux/bitmal is old namee
if you want to see what are the container is running write the command
**docker ps -- it will shows running containers
and it will display the results 
suppose we you want to stop the containers because it will consuming all of the resource in the local system 
**docker stop ee36(contianer ID four dight number)
if you want to see the all the container running or stopped 
**docker ps -a --> it shows all the container it what exited or running 

if suppose there are multiple container is running by using trone command it can delete whatare the containers is stopped 

Port mapping 
if suppose we know any port is free so we want mapped 
so procedure is 
docker run -p 9000:8080 bitnami/nignux  ---> normal format to follow 
9000 -- is free port which we already know
8080 -- old port number which is currrently running 
when you use localhost 9000 it will so the nignux page 
if suppose 8080 is busy so that mapping 9000 it will use it ---- no need down the default 8080 instead it changing to new port 9000 , this is the utility of port mapping 

some basics command
if suppose you need to get the all the log for that
docker log containers name ---> you need to mention the container name to pull

if suppose the we need to the container 
docker exec -it fo49 bash   ---->  exec mean executative ,i mean indirect t stands for terminal , f049 - container ID ,
if press enter
root@f049 --> it will into the conatiner now we can see the ls , ps 
if suppose the we want to exit container 
exit --> just type and click the enter 

Everything will work in visual studio code
Create the docker file 
first you have to create app
1:41
after that create docker file 
touch Docker file --> always D is in capital
before writing the docker file you need to mention base image --> that is which version
1:52 
we are going to buit docker image 
docker buit -t helopython :1.0.

In short brief 
first we have to create code for the app 
after that in requiment tab we have to add which software is used
open the docker file in that add the procedure from where it to start and port access etc 
after you have pull that image 
after that run the image 
if its correct everything will executive
